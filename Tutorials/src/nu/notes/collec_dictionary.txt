Python (3) Collection type: Dictionary
   
    from "Hello World - Second Edition" by Wayne Sande and Carter Sande:
  " 
    A python dictionary is a type of collection used to associate objects to 
    each other. These two things are called the key and value. Each item or 
    entry in a dictionary has a key and a value, referred to as key-value pairs.
  " 
    
    Dictionaries are syntaxed with curly brackets { }
    Within them are key-value pairs separated by a colon : and a comma
    between every key-value pair
    
    They could be formatted to look like json:
    {
      # format:
      # <key>:<value>
        "Bob": "444-4321"
        "Jenny": "867-5309"
        "John": "555-1234"
        "Mary": "555-6789"
    }
    
    The key value can only be immutable types (bool, int, str, float, tuple)
    
    A dictionary cannot be sorted, as it has no concept of sorting.
    To add to a dictionary, simply equate a key value enclosed in square brckts
    after a dictionary:
        phoneNumbers = {}
        phoneNumbers["Mary"] = "555-6789"
