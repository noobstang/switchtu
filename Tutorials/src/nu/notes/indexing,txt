From ITI1120 - Lab 04:  Indexing operator, revisited

    "The indexing operator returns the character at index i (as a single character string)."

s[i:j]  # the slice of s starting at index i and ending before index j
s[i:]   # the slice of s starting at index i
s[:j]   # the slice of s ending before index j
s[::k]  # slice picking character for every 'k' index
    ex. 'Sillygoose'[::2] == 'Slyos'


       0  1  2  3  4

s =  ' A  p  p  l  e '       # there are no blank spaces in the string. Visibility purposes.

      -5 -4 -3 -2 -1

s[0:2]   # 'Ap'
s[1:4]   # 'ppl'
s[2:5]   # 'ple'
s[2:]    # 'ple'
s[:2]    # 'Ap'
s[-3:-1] # 'pl'
