For loops:

utilizes range() function to generate iterating sequence.
    for i in range(0, 5):
        # iterates the loop body 5 times, each time i increases 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
        # range() is not inclusive of the second integer itself.
    s = "Hello world"
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # iterates the loop by the length of string s, 11 in this case

While loops:

utilizes boolean condition to determine iteration
    # iterate by number of slices. The function body sets the iteration condition.
    # while loops have the danger of infinite looping if the condition is not set correctly.
    pizza = True
    slices = 8
    while pizza = True:
        slices = slices - 1
        if slices ==0:
            pizza = False
