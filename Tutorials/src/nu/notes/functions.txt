Key: functions
    
    abs() , min() , and max() are called functions.
    In Python, functions are similar to those in Java, where they can be called to perform
    certain tasks and/or return values from certain operations.

    From https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.html
    Functions that Return Values

    "Functions that return values are sometimes called fruitful functions. In many other languages, a chunk that doesnâ€™t return a value is called a procedure, 
    but we will stick here with the Python way of also calling it a function, or if we want to stress it, a non-fruitful function.

    Fruitful functions still allow the user to provide information (arguments). However there is now an additional piece of data that is returned from the function."
    
    A custom function must be defined with keyword 'def', followed by function name and colon,
    with the desired code written with an indent level.
    
    ex:
    def hello_world(n):
        print("hello world")
        return n
