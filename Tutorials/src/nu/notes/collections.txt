Data structures and Collections in Python (3):

definitions:
mutable/immutable:  whether the collection can be changed after creation
sorted/unsorted:    whether the collection is automatically sorted in order
ordered/unordered:  whether the collection elements are accessible through index

    lists - mutable, unsorted, ordered, allows duplicates
        multiple objects surrounded by square brackets [] Ex:
            [1, 4, 6]
            ["hello", "world", "no u"]
            [[1,4,6], ["hello", "world", "no u"]]

    tuples - immutable, unsorted, ordered, allows duplicates
        surrounded by round brackets () Ex:
            (1, 4, 6)
            ("hello", "world", "no u")
            ([1,4,6], ["hello", "world", "no u"])

    dictionaries - mutable, (unsorted,) unordered, no duplicates
          # dictionaries store key:value pairs 
              # - a.k.a. associative arrays, hash tables, etc.
          # access elements with key value
        surrounded by curly brackets {}
            {
              # format:
              # <key>:<value>
                "Bob": "444-4321"
                "Jenny": "867-5309"
                "John": "555-1234"
                "Mary": "555-6789"
            }
