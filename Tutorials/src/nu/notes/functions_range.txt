    The function range() is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers in a
      specified range

    Iterate over n numbers 0, 1, 2, ... , n-1
      for i in range(n):

    Iterate over n numbers k, k+1, k+2, ... , n-1
      for i in range(k, n):

    Iterate over n numbers k, k+c, k+2c, k+3c, ... , n-1
      for i in range(k, n, c):

In particular the first time a program encounters a for-
loop it creates the variable whose name follows the keyword for. 

In the above examples, the variable name is i. 
Then that variable, i in this case, takes values in the given range one by one. 
Each time it takes the next value it enters the for-loop and executes its body. 
The for-loop terminates after i has taken on all the values in the range, as shown above
