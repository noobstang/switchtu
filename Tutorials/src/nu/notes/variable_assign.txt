Key: Variables and assignments
    a variable, such as x (any alphanumerical name) , can be assigned a value
    when the variable appears inside an expression, it evaluates to its assigned value

    a variable (name) does not exist until it is assigned

    The assignment statement has the format:
        <variable> = <expression>

    <expression> is evaluated first before being assigned to variable <variable>

    In Python, variable names consist of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and underscores. Cannot begin with a digit.
      For multi-word names, use underscore spaces or camelCase capitalization.
    "Short and meaningful names are ideal".
